We're proud to announce that TortoiseSVN 1.9.3 has been released.
It is linked against Subversion 1.9.3.

This is a a bugfix release with two security issues fixed in the SVN library:

* <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2015-5259-advisory.txt">CVE-2015-5259</a>: Heap overflow and out-of-bounds read in <code>svn://</code> protocol parser</li>
* <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2015-5343-advisory.txt">CVE-2015-5343</a>: Heap overflow and out-of-bounds read in mod_dav_svn</li>

Please read the <a href="/tsvn_1.9_releasenotes.html">release notes</a>

Apart from the features listed in the release notes, there were also
a lot of smaller improvements which are too many to list.
