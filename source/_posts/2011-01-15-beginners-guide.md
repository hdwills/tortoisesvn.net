title: TortoiseSVN 1.7 Beginner's Guide
---


There's now a <a href="http://link.packtpub.com/qcmkxs">book</a> available about TortoiseSVN.
Of course, there are books about Subversion which mention TortoiseSVN.
But this is (I think) the first book about TortoiseSVN.


Full disclosure: I was asked to <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/author_reviewing_for_packt">review</a>
the book, which I did. And I'm mentioned as a reviewer in
the book! So I had to write something about it here since
I was never mentioned in a book before :).

Read my [full post](/beginnersguide.html) about this book.
